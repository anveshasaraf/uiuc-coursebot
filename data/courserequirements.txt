COMPUTER SCIENCE, BS
for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
The Computer Science curriculum provides both a broad and deep 
knowledge of the theory, design, and application of computer systems, 
with an emphasis on software systems. Because computing is 
ubiquitous, application areas involve virtually any ﬁeld imaginable - from 
developing gene sequencing algorithms via techniques in computational 
biology, to designing user interfaces for mobile applications; from 
designing methods for high frequency trading, to creating computer 
generated graphics and special effects in the gaming industry; and 
from creating embedded real time systems to be deployed in medical 
devices, to analyzing social data from internet communication patterns. 
During the ﬁrst two years the curriculum provides a strong foundation in 
mathematics, science, and computation. Advanced coursework both in 
more technical core areas and in areas of the student's choosing follows 
in the second two years. Graduates regularly go on to graduate study or 
leading positions in industry.
Both a combined B.S.-M.S. degree program and a B.S-M.C.S. degree 
program are available. The admission and course requirements are 
described on the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science website
(https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/).

Computer Science Advanced Electives
Code Title Hours
Students must take for a letter grade a minimum of two (2) 
advanced elective courses comprising at least six (6) credit 
hours. These advanced elective courses must be distinct from 
courses used to satisfy the technical electives. They may 
be chosen from CS 397 Individual Study and the 400-level 
coursework offered for letter grade in ANY area offered at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It is expected that 
students will select these additional advanced courses in a way 
that best augments their program of study. Consultation with a 
faculty mentors is highly encouraged. A maximum of six (6) credit 
hours of CS 397 may be used in the combination of technical 
electives and advanced electives.

Sample Sequence
This sample sequence is intended to be used only as a guide for degree 
completion. All students should work individually with their academic 
advisors to decide the actual course selection and sequence that works 
best for them based on their academic preparation and goals. Enrichment 
programming such as study abroad, minors, internships, and so on may 
impact the structure of this four-year plan. Course availability is not 
guaranteed during the semester indicated in the sample sequence. The 
curriculum sequence can also be viewed via dynamic and static curricular 
maps (https://grainger.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors-
and-minors/cs-map/), which include prerequisite sequencing.
Students must fulﬁll their Language Other Than English requirement by 
successfully completing a third level of a language other than English. 
See the corresponding section on the Degree and General Education 
Requirements (http://catalog.illinois.edu/general-information/degree-

will satisfy a core course requirement and the Campus General Education 
Advanced Composition requirement.
