CS Beyond STEM w/ Python
Restricted to Undergrad - Urbana-Champaign.
Topic: CS Beyond STEM w/ Python <br/> Computer science is a growing field with growing impact in a vast variety of areas,
including agricultural innovations, social sciences research methods, social networks, and language processing. To match the
wealth of fields computer science can impact, CS+X and interdisciplinary programs are rapidly growing in availability. As an
introduction to these options, this course provides a broad exposure to the various non-STEM fields that computer science combines
with: music, anthropology, linguistics, advertising, agriculture, and philosophy. The course introduces students to the questions,
ideas, and ethical considerations that drive each field, as well as to coding in Python. Students will read articles, individually reflect
on them, and discuss ethics and challenges in class. Students will also create projects in Python. The open-ended nature of projects
encourages students to focus on exploring the pieces that most interest them. No prior programming experience is required.
Not intended for CS and blended CS majors or Engineering tuition program students.

Luo, N
Cryptography is a powerful toolbox for building secure systems --- not just for private communication, but also for building fault
tolerant protocols, for securely outsourcing computation to untrusted services, and more. The goal of this course is to introduce the
concepts of modern cryptography, including a combination of theoretical foundations (how do we precisely state security guarantees
and assumptions, and prove that a protocol is designed correctly?) and practical techniques (how do we combine secure primitives
to make effective systems?). This course is intended for senior undergraduate students with an interest in applying cryptographic
techniques to building secure systems, and for graduate students with an interest in cryptography or systems security.
CS 409 The Art of Web Programming credit: 3 OR 4 hours.
Client- and server-side technologies that enable modern Web applications. Topics include the building blocks of the Web (browsers,
HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and data exchange (HTTP, AJAX, JSON, REST). Assignments expose students to full-stack web
development, and JavaScript frameworks that scaffold MVC architectures and event-driven, asynchronous programming. The course
culminates in a final project, where students work in teams to design and develop an original, database-backed web application. 3
undergraduate hours. 3 or 4 graduate hours. Prerequisite: CS 225.

Cyber Dystopia
Restricted to Undergrad - Urbana-Champaign.
Most university training in Computer Science focuses on technology advancement: writing more efficient programs, mining over
bigger data, teaching a computer to more accurately distinguish a cat from a dog, and so on. The Cyber Dystopia course focuses
instead on the downsides of such technology advancement. Course participants will explore history and context, characterize key
problems, assess their severity, predict their future, speculate on how much of what we are facing is inevitable, and think about what

Emerging ML models (like deep neural networks) tend to be complex, fragile, non-robust, and uninterpretable. This makes it
extremely challenging to build reliable real-world systems that incorporate ML components. We need trustworthy ML as well as
robust system design to achieve end-to-end correctness of systems. In this course, we will study recent developments at the
intersection of formal methods (FM), programming languages (PL) and machine learning (ML) research towards the development
of trustworthy AI-based systems. Some topics planned covered for the course are: 1. Formal Verification of ML models using
abstraction and constraint solvers 2. Symbolic explanations of deep neural networks 3. Training ML models with Logic and
Knowledge 4. Learning symbolic concepts (code, program synthesis, invariants) 5. Proving correctness of systems with ML
components 6. Neurosymbolic machine learning For up-to-date information about CS course restrictions, please see the following

This course presents an in-depth, integrative overview of the major themes in the study of Cognitive Science, including cognition
as computation, the relation between mind and brain, computability and the role of heuristics in “solving” unsolvable problems, and
the logical/mathematical foundations of these themes. Specific topics include inverse optics and vision; induction and reasoning;
learnability and language; philosophy of minds and brains; evolution; artificial intelligence and computational modeling; information
theory; knowledge representation. The emphasis throughout is on the interrelations among these topics as examples of important
but fundamentally unsolvable problems. This course is the same as PSYCH 514, Seminar in Cognitive Science, and replaces
PSYCH 458, Cognitive Science.

Topic: AI Efficiency: Systems & Algorithms Are you curious about how system techniques enable today's large-scale model training
and deliver ultra-fast inference? Do you have a passion for making AI accessible to all by using advanced system and algorithm
techniques, thereby significantly reducing the cost of training and deploying deep learning models? If so, this course is for you.
The course provides an in-depth view of AI efficiency, focusing on the core concepts of both AI systems and algorithmic methods.
We will explore and discuss seminal works in the field of AI systems, such as ZeRO-style data parallelism, tensor parallelism,
pipeline parallelism, sequence parallelism, and 3D parallelism. We will also go over inference optimization techniques, such as
FlashAttention, blocked KV cache, speculative decoding, and various compression algorithms. Students will have the opportunity
to present existing works in the field of AI efficiency and learn to write paper reviews, which help develop critical thinking skills.
Students will also work on group projects, which involve the design, hands-on implementation, and evaluation of AI systems
or algorithms. The group project will provide students with valuable experience in working with real AI systems, and a deeper
understanding of the complexities involved in optimizing AI efficiency. For up-to-date information about CS course restrictions,

In this course, we will explore recent advances in detecting and discouraging antisocial behavior and fostering desirable behavior
on the Internet. Focusing on a combination of sociological foundations and recent advances in HCI, NLP, and human-centered AI,
we will examine online moderation through three lenses: understanding, building, and evaluating. <br/> First, we will survey the
large spectrum of antisocial (and desirable) behavior prevalent on the Internet and understand how current research defines such
behavior. Next, we will examine existing moderation tools built using computational techniques and social computing theory. Finally,
we will review experimental studies, surveys and real-time deployments that evaluate the efficacy of moderation strategies. <br/>
