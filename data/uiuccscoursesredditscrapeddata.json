      "body": "Not that long ago people thought smoking was not just safe but even healthy. How will future generations look back on our current use of information technology?\n\n* Are smartphones responsible for dramatic recent increases in rates of self-harm, depression, and anxiety, particularly for adolescents?\n* Does social media connect or isolate us?\n* Is the web a source of information or disinformation?\n* Will AI save us or enslave us?\n\nIf you're interested in discussing these questions, please consider enrolling in [CS 199 SOC: Technology and Society](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2024/fall/CS/199). (Note that there are multiple sections of CS 199 that are all different: please sign up for the right one!)\n\nCS 199 SOC is not a technical course‚Äîno code will be written and engagement with technical concepts will be limited. Instead, this is an opportunity for us to explore and understand our relationship with technology: How we shape it, and how it shapes us. Anyone who's life is affected by technology is welcome to enroll‚Äîwhich means pretty much everyone. We're all involuntary participants in this ongoing societal experiment‚Äîwe might as well try to understand what's happening to us.\n\nTogether, we'll read, reflect, discuss, and experiment:\n\n* **Read**: Each week we'll complete a reading that engages the topics of the course. Excellent texts intended for a general audience will be used‚Äîso no need to slog through turgid academic prose. But students should be prepared to do several hours of reading each week.\n\n* **Reflect**: We'll write a page or two each week reflecting on that week's reading‚Äîwith a pen, on paper.\n\n* **Discuss**: On Friday's from 2‚Äì3:30PM in Siebel 1214 we'll meet to discuss the readings. We'll divide into pairs to allow us to fully engage with each other and ensure that everyone has a chance to both speak and listen.\n\n* **Experiment**: And in the most fun part of the course, we'll engage in a series of experiments motivated by what we're discussing. Some will be thought experiments. Others will engage us with the world around us in new ways. Others will represent minor behavior modifications. The goal is to tweak our existing patterns of interaction with technology to better understand our current habits and potentially develop new ones.\n\nFinally, while this course will approach technology from a critical perspective, it is open to anyone who wants to examine their relationship with technology. Information technology is neither completely harmful nor completely beneficial. The nature of its impact on the world depends on how we relate to it, and that relationship will be different for each of us. Our goal together will be to ensure that the relationship is an informed one.\n\nI'm happy to answer questions in the space below. And feel free to come by the first meeting: next Friday, (8/30/2024), 2‚Äì3:30PM, Siebel 1214.\n\nLate edit: [here's the syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qvol-1FeMeCbbF0VyRmc1UzunSChrPur7rgCh6fCVdE/edit#heading=h.o9dzcdr2r4ht).\n",

      "bodyHtml": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Not that long ago people thought smoking was not just safe but even healthy. How will future generations look back on our current use of information technology?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are smartphones responsible for dramatic recent increases in rates of self-harm, depression, and anxiety, particularly for adolescents?</li>\n<li>Does social media connect or isolate us?</li>\n<li>Is the web a source of information or disinformation?</li>\n<li>Will AI save us or enslave us?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in discussing these questions, please consider enrolling in <a href=\"https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2024/fall/CS/199\">CS 199 SOC: Technology and Society</a>. (Note that there are multiple sections of CS 199 that are all different: please sign up for the right one!)</p>\n\n<p>CS 199 SOC is not a technical course‚Äîno code will be written and engagement with technical concepts will be limited. Instead, this is an opportunity for us to explore and understand our relationship with technology: How we shape it, and how it shapes us. Anyone who&#39;s life is affected by technology is welcome to enroll‚Äîwhich means pretty much everyone. We&#39;re all involuntary participants in this ongoing societal experiment‚Äîwe might as well try to understand what&#39;s happening to us.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we&#39;ll read, reflect, discuss, and experiment:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Read</strong>: Each week we&#39;ll complete a reading that engages the topics of the course. Excellent texts intended for a general audience will be used‚Äîso no need to slog through turgid academic prose. But students should be prepared to do several hours of reading each week.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Reflect</strong>: We&#39;ll write a page or two each week reflecting on that week&#39;s reading‚Äîwith a pen, on paper.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Discuss</strong>: On Friday&#39;s from 2‚Äì3:30PM in Siebel 1214 we&#39;ll meet to discuss the readings. We&#39;ll divide into pairs to allow us to fully engage with each other and ensure that everyone has a chance to both speak and listen.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Experiment</strong>: And in the most fun part of the course, we&#39;ll engage in a series of experiments motivated by what we&#39;re discussing. Some will be thought experiments. Others will engage us with the world around us in new ways. Others will represent minor behavior modifications. The goal is to tweak our existing patterns of interaction with technology to better understand our current habits and potentially develop new ones.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, while this course will approach technology from a critical perspective, it is open to anyone who wants to examine their relationship with technology. Information technology is neither completely harmful nor completely beneficial. The nature of its impact on the world depends on how we relate to it, and that relationship will be different for each of us. Our goal together will be to ensure that the relationship is an informed one.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m happy to answer questions in the space below. And feel free to come by the first meeting: next Friday, (8/30/2024), 2‚Äì3:30PM, Siebel 1214.</p>\n\n<p>Late edit: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qvol-1FeMeCbbF0VyRmc1UzunSChrPur7rgCh6fCVdE/edit#heading=h.o9dzcdr2r4ht\">here&#39;s the syllabus</a>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "body": "Not that long ago people thought smoking was not just safe but even healthy. How will future generations look back on our current use of information technology?\n\n* Are smartphones responsible for dramatic recent increases in rates of self-harm, depression, and anxiety, particularly for adolescents?\n* Does social media connect or isolate us?\n* Is the web a source of information or disinformation?\n* Will AI save us or enslave us?\n\nIf you're interested in discussing these questions, please consider enrolling in [CS 199 SOC: Technology and Society](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2024/fall/CS/199). (Note that there are multiple sections of CS 199 that are all different: please sign up for the right one!)\n\nCS 199 SOC is not a technical course‚Äîno code will be written and engagement with technical concepts will be limited. Instead, this is an opportunity for us to explore and understand our relationship with technology: How we shape it, and how it shapes us. Anyone who's life is affected by technology is welcome to enroll‚Äîwhich means pretty much everyone. We're all involuntary participants in this ongoing societal experiment‚Äîwe might as well try to understand what's happening to us.\n\nTogether, we'll read, reflect, discuss, and experiment:\n\n* **Read**: Each week we'll complete a reading that engages the topics of the course. Excellent texts intended for a general audience will be used‚Äîso no need to slog through turgid academic prose. But students should be prepared to do several hours of reading each week.\n\n* **Reflect**: We'll write a page or two each week reflecting on that week's reading‚Äîwith a pen, on paper.\n\n* **Discuss**: On Friday's from 2‚Äì3:30PM in Siebel 1214 we'll meet to discuss the readings.

How will future generations look back on our current use of information technology?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are smartphones responsible for dramatic recent increases in rates of self-harm, depression, and anxiety, particularly for adolescents?</li>\n<li>Does social media connect or isolate us?</li>\n<li>Is the web a source of information or disinformation?</li>\n<li>Will AI save us or enslave us?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in discussing these questions, please consider enrolling in <a href=\"https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2024/fall/CS/199\">CS 199 SOC: Technology and Society</a>. (Note that there are multiple sections of CS 199 that are all different: please sign up for the right one!)</p>\n\n<p>CS 199 SOC is not a technical course‚Äîno code will be written and engagement with technical concepts will be limited. Instead, this is an opportunity for us to explore and understand our relationship with technology: How we shape it, and how it shapes us. Anyone who&#39;s life is affected by technology is welcome to enroll‚Äîwhich means pretty much everyone. We&#39;re all involuntary participants in this ongoing societal experiment‚Äîwe might as well try to understand what&#39;s happening to us.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we&#39;ll read, reflect, discuss, and experiment:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Read</strong>: Each week we&#39;ll complete a reading that engages the topics of the course. Excellent texts intended for a general audience will be used‚Äîso no need to slog through turgid academic prose. But students should be prepared to do several hours of reading each week.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Reflect</strong>: We&#39;ll write a page or two each week reflecting on that week&#39;s reading‚Äîwith a pen, on paper.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Discuss</strong>: On Friday&#39;s from 2‚Äì3:30PM in Siebel 1214 we&#39;ll meet to discuss the readings. We&#39;ll divide into pairs to allow us to fully engage with each other and ensure that everyone has a chance to both speak and listen.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Experiment</strong>: And in the most fun part of the course, we&#39;ll engage in a series of experiments motivated by what we&#39;re discussing.

For example, what if the first elective I take counts for my degree but can also count for my MCS requirements. I prefer transferring that course instead of the other two but I'm worried I'm not allowed because at the time I couldn't graduate without taking that course.\n\nBut the 3rd elective (which I don't need to transfer) is a course I could've not taken and still graduated.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nAm I allowed to choose which courses to transfer or is there a restriction of any kind?\n\nThanks",
